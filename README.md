# uComposer

This is an old project I was working on that is not really in any state to be used by anyone, but I uploaded here as a preservation measure.

It is a node-based audio synthesizer framework written in C++. Includes support for many basic audio processing effects, including a couple synthesizers, some audio filters, ADSR envelopes, note lanes, and parameter and tempo automation.
